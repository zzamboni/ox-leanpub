;;; Commentary:

;; Export an Org file in multiple files and directories in the structure
;; required by Leanpub, including the necessary `manuscript/' directory and the
;; `Book.txt', `Sample.txt' and `Subset.txt' files. It can use either Markua or
;; LFM as the export backend through the `ox-leanpub-markua' and
;; `ox-leanpub-markdown' libraries.
;;
;; See full documentation in the README.org file or at

  "Exports buffer to a Leanpub book.

The buffer is split by top level headlines, populating the
corresponding book-specification files.

EXPORT-FUNCTION is a regular Org exporter function, which must
receives three optional arguments ASYNC (which is always passed
as nil), SUBTREEP and VISIBLE-ONLY (which are passed unchanged
from the corresponding arguments received). In particular, the
SUBTREEP option must be obeyed for the current-chapter export to
work. Files will be created with the extension EXPORT-EXTENSION.
EXPORT-BACKEND-SYMBOL is the name (symbol) of the exporter to
use.

DO-SAMPLE-FILE specifies whether the `Sample.txt' file should be
generated (in Leanpub this is only needed for Markdown books, for
Markua it is handled through conditional directives in the text
itself). ONLY-SUBSET specified whether only the book subset
should be exported (without the entire book). If ONLY-SUBSET is
t, then the type of subset which should be produced is
determined as follows:

- If SUBTREEP is t, then only the current chapter is
  included.
- Otherwise, the value of the `#+LEANPUB_BOOK_WRITE_SUBSET'
  buffer option is used. The valid values are `none' (default,
  not created), `tagged' (use all chapters tagged `subset'),
  `all' (all the chapters), `sample' (chapters tagged `sample'),
  `current' (chapter where the cursor is at the moment of the
  export).

This function is used internally by `ox-leanpub-book' and should
normally not be called directly by the user."
